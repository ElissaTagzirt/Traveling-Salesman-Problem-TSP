L'algorithme est comme suit:\n","  * On commence par initialiser le tableau des scores (coefficients).\n","  * Ensuite, on choisit une heuristique aléatoirement en tenant compte des coefficients.\n","  * Enfin, on applique l'heuristique pour construire la tournée complète.\n","\n"," On répète l'algorithme un certain nombre d'itérations et on choisit la meilleure tournée obtenue.\n","\n","2. **ACO** : Dans le problème d'optimisation du voyageur de commerce, l'approche classique utilisant cette métaheuristique repose sur deux principes : la visibilité, qui est la distance entre les villes, et les phéromones, qui influencent le choix de la prochaine ville. Cependant, dans le cadre des hyper-heuristiques, bien que le principe des phéromones puisse être appliqué facilement, le concept de visibilité est moins évident. En effet, les villes sont remplacées par des heuristiques de bas niveau et il n'existe pas de notion de distance entre ces heuristiques. Pour pallier cela, la visibilité est définie par le temps CPU requis par une heuristique. Les heuristiques avec un temps CPU plus faible sont ainsi privilégiées.\n","  * **ACO avec les threads** : Nous avons parallélisé le travail des fourmis pour améliorer le temps d'exécution, ce qui s'est avéré bénéfique lors des tests. Par la suite, nous avons généré un jeu de données pour entraîner un modèle de machine learning destiné à la prédiction des paramètres, ce qui nous a permis de gagner énormément de temps.\n","  * **ACO avec les threads parametres initialise par un modele**: Nous avons ensuite développé un modèle en utilisant des techniques de machine learning. Ce modèle prend en entrée l'instance du graphe, le nombre de villes, les heuristiques utilisées et leur nombre, et prédit les paramètres nécessaires (nombre de fourmis, nombre d'itérations, quantité initiale de phéromones, valeurs d'alpha et de beta, taux d'évaporation et constante Q).\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n"],"metadata":{"id":"FpmZ06M4p59o"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["## 1.
